# ðŸ“Š Retail Sales Dashboard â€” Power BI Project
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a retail sales dashboard I built as part of a hands-on data visualization task. The goal was to create a clean and interactive Power BI report that helps business users understand key sales trends, category performance, and regional distribution over time.

## ðŸ§  Objective
To design a simple yet insightful dashboard that shows:
- How sales have changed month-over-month
- Which regions and product categories perform best
- Key sales metrics like total revenue, average sale, and order volume

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Source
I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle:
ðŸ”— [Retail Sales Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)

This dataset contains sales records including Order id, Order Date, Region, Category, and Sales amount.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Power BI** â€“ For designing the dashboard  
- **Google Colab (Python)** â€“ For data cleaning and date formatting  
- **Pandas & Matplotlib** â€“ Used lightly during cleaning to explore and format the dataset

## âœ… Outcome
This project gave me hands-on experience in using Python and Power BI to turn raw retail data into meaningful business insights. It helped me practice not just technical skills but also storytelling through visuals.
